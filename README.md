Performs a nested cross-validation grid search across various machine learning families.

The genotypic data used in this study is available from the 1001 Arabidopsis Project
(https://1001genomes.org/data/GMI-MPI/releases/v3.1/SNP_matrix_imputed_hdf5/
1001_SNP_MATRIX.tar.gz). The following phenotypic data was downloaded from the AraPheno
database: flowering time at 10°C (https://arapheno.1001genomes.org/phenotype/261/), flowering time
at 16°C (https://arapheno.1001genomes.org/phenotype/262/), leaf area
(https://arapheno.1001genomes.org/phenotype/108/), seed yield
(https://arapheno.1001genomes.org/phenotype/124/)
